How to run (easy setup)
Backend (Node/Express)

Create backend/.env with these keys (fill with real values):
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/learnhub
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_yourkey
STRIPE_PRICE_ID=price_12345
AWS_ACCESS_KEY=your-key
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your-secret
AWS_BUCKET=your-s3-bucket
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
PORT=8000
Install and run:
cd backend
npm install
npm start // or: node index.js if you donâ€™t have a start script
Frontend (React + Tailwind)

Create frontend/.env with these keys:
If you run backend and frontend on different hosts/ports, ensure the frontend proxy (Vite) forwards /api to your backend (see vite.config.js in this scaffold).
Notes on running together

You can also run both with concurrently:
In root, add a script to package.json:
"scripts": {
"start:backend": "node backend/index.js",
"start:frontend": "cd frontend && npm run start",
"start": "concurrently "npm run start:backend" "npm run start:frontend""
}
Install: npm install concurrently
Then npm start
Key considerations and next steps (easy pointers)
Authentication/authorization
Add a simple admin flag on User and guard /api/courses (POST) behind it.
Consider refresh tokens; this scaffold uses a basic JWT.
WebRTC live streams
The scaffold includes placeholders. For a real live stream, add a signaling server (Socket.IO is a good place) and a real SFU (e.g., mediasoup) or SimplePeer-based approach.
Quizzes
The codebase includes a Quiz model skeleton. Add endpoints to fetch quizzes by course, submit answers, and compute scores.
Recommendations
Start with a simple content-based approach (as in the example) and then add Redis-backed interaction data to power a simple collaborative filter later.
Payments
Add proper Stripe webhooks to grant access on successful payments; this scaffold has a basic webhook endpoint for development.
Media storage
Use S3 for thumbnails and video metadata; store URLs in the database. For secured access, generate expiring URLs when serving media.
Real-time chat
Messages are persisted in Redis (per room) for easy scaling. For multiple instances, Redis pub/sub can broadcast to all workers.
